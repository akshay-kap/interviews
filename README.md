I recently concluded a job search, during which a few companies assigned take-home coding assignments.
These assignments varied in difficulty, from "spend no more than 4 hours" to "you have as long as you need".
I am consolidating and sharing these with the same level of detail that each company approved for the original submissions: a public git repository.

I'm sharing this repository as a public data point.
Perhaps one day, I'll write a longer opinion piece with my take on take-home coding assignments.
