# About

This is a [Hybrids](https://hybrids.js.org/) app that displays downloadable file data as a table.
An NPM script is included for local dev convenience, but the project is organized as plain HTML, CSS, and JS files.

I decided not to automate any testing since the project is small enough to test exhaustively in a couple minutes.
I tested on my MacBook Pro (macOS 10.13.6) using Chrome v80, Safari v13, and Firefox v74.
This app uses several ES2015 constructs, so without a compile step it will not work properly in older browsers.
